# Currency-Converter
Currency Converter is an app which the users can convert currencies by clicking Get Rates button while taking euro as a base currency. There are 6 currencies, CAD, CHF, GBP, JPY, USD, TRY, which can be converted based on Euro. The users can click Get Rates button and see result. In this app, I used API(Application Programming Interface) in order to take data from Internet. Fixer.io is a web site which provides data to the app. I created the labels and button and follow the path to build API structure which are Request & Session, Response & Data, and Parsing & Json Serialisation. Besides, I benefited from if-statements, DispatchQueue, and do-try-catch structure to built the app.
